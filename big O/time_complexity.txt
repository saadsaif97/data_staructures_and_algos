HOW THE RUN TIME OF FUNCTION GROWS AS THE INPUT GROWS
THIS RELATION IS CALLED BIG O
-----------------------------------------------------

simplify the O notations

-- Arithmetic operations are constant
-- Variable assignment is constant
-- Accessing the element in array or object is constant
-- In LOOPS, the complexity id the length of the loop times the complexity of what happens inside the loop
